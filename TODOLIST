Some files need to be ported to the new architecture some day :
 - indicator/esi.c
 - indicator/sup_res.c
 - indicator/xtr.c
 - input/google.c

New object is required, extract positions managements from sim.c & make it usable on any timeline_entry.
Make it possible to get n shares or 1/nth of a share depending on an initial capital or increasing one to simulate a "real" investor with other revenues.
For easier computation, maybe only compute the weighted value of these shares.
